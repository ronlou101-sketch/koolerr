# COMPLETED_WORK.md

> Foreman SoT: completed work **as claimed by sources**. Does not invent completion. Conflicts preserved.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Base for new implementation branches** | current **`master`** (tip `945f30840680790fcdbced49790a28372e9aab47`) |
| **Historical SoT locus** | `feat/phase-5-6-launch-integrity` (HEAD at SoT pack creation: `b5283625f7e6f78a9382a9a51d4340abdee0f2da`) |

## Foreman SoT pack slice — ✅ COMPLETE (agent-ops work, not product work)

**Evidence:** PR **#2** (`docs: Foreman canonical SoT pack (docs-only)`), **merged** into `master` at SHA **`945f30840680790fcdbced49790a28372e9aab47`** (`945f308`).

- Delivered: the nine root Foreman SoT markdown files, documentation-only.
- Outcome: the SoT pack now lives on `master`; subsequent Claude Code implementation branches are cut from `master` (`DECISIONS.md` O2).
- Slice closed: `ACTIVE_SLICE.md` has moved on to the SoT operational refresh.

**This closes an operating-documentation slice only.** It completes **no** product phase, milestone, or launch gate, and it does **not** resolve any conflict in `DECISIONS.md` (C1–C7 remain open).

## Phase 7 — Launch Readiness (aligned across sources)

**Evidence:** `PHASE_7_COMPLETION.md`, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `FOUNDATION_003`, Tracker, `docs/status.json`.

- Status: Complete; tagged `phase-7-complete`.
- Test count cited in Phase 7 report: 756 → **833** (+77).
- Milestones completed (7.1, 7.2, 7.3a, 7.3b, 7.4, 7.7, 7.8) per `PHASE_7_COMPLETION.md`.
- Deferred (explicitly not complete): 7.3c, 7.5, 7.6, 7.9 — each needs founder approval (`PHASE_7_COMPLETION.md`, `docs/status.json` remaining).

---

## Launch Phases 8–9 — **CONFLICTING CLAIMS**

| Source | Phase 8 | Phase 9 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md` | Next / not complete | Planned |
| `FOUNDATION_003`, Tracker, `status.json` current[10] | ✅ `phase-8-complete` | ✅ `phase-9-complete` |

Do **not** mark 8–9 complete in Foreman active slice language until founder resolves. See `DECISIONS.md`.

## Phase 5–6 product history (branch naming context)

From `docs/status.json` current entries (summaries):

- **Phase 5 — Core V1 Experiences** — Milestone 5.5 Operational Readiness cited complete; “Phase 5 complete.”
- **Phase 6 — Launch Integrity** — Milestones 6.1–6.6 cited complete; Stripe webhook-secret hardening deferred.

---

## Experience Workstream Phase 13 (Tracker / status.json)

- Slice A — Unified Review queue ✅ (founder-approved / production claims in status.json).
- Slice B — Review primary nav + badge ✅.
- Slice C — Pipeline → New campaign modal ✅.

Plan: `docs/PHASE_13_EXPERIENCE_WORKSTREAM.md`. History: `docs/history/PHASE_13_SLICE_A_COMPLETION.md`.

## Campaign Rendering (ADR-025) — code-complete claim with honesty caveat

Tracker / status.json: CR-1…CR-6c2 described as code-complete and pushed; honesty notes that runtime production verification of the full render loop may still be outstanding in older Tracker prose (“Next: M2 — prove it in production”). Later `status.json` entries claim Step 5 production video proof and Step 6 provider verification founder-accepted on this branch — **preserve both layers**; do not collapse into a single “done” without founder confirmation of which proof closes which gate.
